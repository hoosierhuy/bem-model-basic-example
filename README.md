This is a basic example of the BEM model, don't worry about the styles, just focus on the structure of the markup and the relative "flatness" of the CSS.  Adapt and modify this pattern as you see fit.

To run: npm i, and gulp command.  In this branch, I used SASS.

tl;dr
Even though this is a BEM demo, I've set this up for general CSS dev without a CSS framework, you might actually not need a framework, depending on your project scope and time horizon.
If your designated browser(s) might not support CSS grids, heaven (or Charles Darwin, your choice) forbid, you can use: @supports (display: grid) {}
